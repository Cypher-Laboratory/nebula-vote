# Introduction to Nebula Vote 🗳️

Welcome to the Nebula Vote documentation! 🚀 Nebula Vote is a cutting-edge platform for private opinion polling on the Starknet blockchain, accessible through Telegram and Discord bots.

## 🤔 What is Nebula Vote?

Nebula Vote combines the power of zero-knowledge cryptography 🔐 with the accessibility of familiar messaging platforms to bring privacy-preserving polls to your communities.

Our platform enables you to create and participate in polls where:
- 🕵️‍♀️ Your identity remains private
- 🛡️ Your vote is cryptographically secured
- ✅ Results are verifiably accurate
- 🔗 All data is stored on the Starknet blockchain

Whether you're running a DAO, managing a community, or simply want to gather opinions without compromising privacy, Nebula Vote provides the tools you need!

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🔒 Privacy-First Design
Built from the ground up with privacy as the core principle. All votes are submitted through zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring nobody—not even the poll creator—can see individual responses.

### 📊 Blockchain Verification
Every poll and vote is recorded on the Starknet blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency of the aggregated results without compromising individual privacy.
This also allows for voters rewards and incentives to be privately distributed automatically. 💸

### 🔌 Seamless Integration
Deploy Nebula Vote directly in your Telegram groups or Discord servers with minimal setup. No need for community members to learn new platforms.

### 🎟️ Token-Gated Voting _(Coming Soon)_
Limit participation to holders of specific tokens or NFTs, with optional minimum balance requirements. Perfect for DAOs and tokenized communities.

## ⚙️ How Does It Work?

Nebula Vote utilizes Ring Signature capabilities to enable private, verifiable voting:

1. **🎯 Poll Creation**: Create a poll through the Telegram or Discord bot, specifying options and settings
2. **🗳️ Private Voting**: Votes are cast using ring signatures that verify eligibility without revealing identity
3. **📝 On-Chain Results**: Aggregated results are publicly verifiable on the blockchain
