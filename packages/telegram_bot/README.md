### Creating Your Own Bot Instance with BotFather

If you want to customize Nebula Vote or run your own instance, you'll need to create a new bot through Telegram's BotFather and run the bot on your server:

1. **Start BotFather**:
   - Open Telegram and search for "@BotFather"
   - Start a chat and send `/start`

2. **Create a New Bot**:
   - Send `/newbot` to BotFather
   - Provide a name for your bot (e.g., "My Nebula Vote")
   - Provide a username for your bot (must end with "bot", e.g., "my_nebula_vote_bot")

3. **Get Your Bot Token**:
   - BotFather will generate a token for your bot
   - This token should be kept private and secure
   - Use this token in your `.env` file as `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`

4. **Configure Bot Settings** (Optional):
   - **Set Description**: `/setdescription` - Brief explanation of what your bot does
   - **Set About Text**: `/setabouttext` - Short info displayed in the bot's profile
   - **Set Profile Picture**: `/setuserpic` - Upload an image for your bot
   - **Set Commands**: `/setcommands` - Define the command menu users will see
     ```
     start - Get started with the bot
     createpoll - Create a new poll
     help - View help information
     ping - Check if the bot is running
     ```

5. **Enable Inline Mode** (Optional, if you want to allow polls in inline mode):
   - Send `/setinline` to BotFather
   - Select your bot
   - Provide a placeholder text (e.g., "Create a new poll")

## üîí How It Works

Nebula Vote leverages Ring Signature cryptography ([Alice's Ring](https://github.com/Cypher-Laboratory/Alice-s-Ring/tree/main)) to enable:

1. **Anonymous but Verifiable Voting**: Votes cannot be traced back to individual voters
2. **Double-Vote Prevention**: The system prevents the same user from voting multiple times
3. **On-Chain Record**: All votes are recorded on Starknet for transparency

The bot's architecture consists of:
- Command handlers for user interaction
- Poll management for creating and tracking polls
- Database operations for storing poll information
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Blockchain interactions for on-chain verification

## üìä Database Schema

The bot uses SQLite with three main tables:
- **Polls**: Stores poll metadata, questions, and timing information
- **Poll Options**: Stores the available options for each poll
- **Votes**: Records anonymous votes while preventing double-voting
